# Detection-of-Cap-and-Expiry-Date-of-LPG-Cylinder
Developed MATLAB and Python image processing solutions for precise LPG cylinder
integrity, expiration, and tally accuracy, ensuring 95% precision in gas supply safety.

Dis.:
The project aims to transition from manual to automated processes for crucial tasks such as cap detection, expiry date identification, and cylinder counting in the context of LPG gas cylinders. Currently reliant on manual execution, these processes are prone to human errors, as noted in the comprehensive literature review. These errors not only undermine operational efficiency but also pose significant safety risks, as evidenced by past incidents. In response to this challenge, the project's title is framed as "Automated Detection of Cap and Expiry Date for LPG Gas Cylinders," reflecting its core objective of implementing advanced technology to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and safety in handling these critical operations.
